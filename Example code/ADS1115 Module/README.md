# ADS1115 Ultra-Small Low-Power I2c Compatible

On electronic cicuits and components, can work with 2 kind of signal, analog and digital

**Digital Signal:** Digital signal are discontinuous in time, give a certain discrete values

**Analog Signal:** Analog signal are a continue in time, for that reason gives data all time and is more precise

The Raspberry pi can't read analog signals, for that reason is require use a ADS1115 Module, this take an analog signal and send information in digital signal.

This module works with any electronical device, such as [Hygrometer FC-28](/Example&#32;code/Hygrometer&#32;FC-28&#32;Sensor), Hall sensor (analog output).
